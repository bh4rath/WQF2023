Frequent: Commom User Activities: Read / Write

Intensive: Resource Intensive: Read - Heavy Payloads

Business Critical - No matter how Non Risky or Edge Cased it might seem e.g. Dashboards, Reports

Legally Enforceable: SLA e.g. Day 1 users would be 100,000 in just 15 minutes. We can't afford an outage

Obvious: User will predominantly see and will complain about e.g. Registration and Auto-Login

Technically Risky

Stakeholder Mandated


A Principle
------------
80 / 20

Not all User Activities, no matter how complex or lucrative it might appear, is eligible for intensive load test. Pareto Principle helps here. At least for prioritization
